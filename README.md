### The Monty Hall Problem Simulatior

This is a simulation program for the Monty Hall Problem. It uses a simple GUI to input how many simulations to do (an arbitrary long integer number) and performs the simulations on a background thread. When the siulations are finished, the result is presented on the GUI along with what desicion made the most wins out of all the simulations (stick to the first choice or take the orhter box).


The simulations chooses to keep the first selected box 50% of the times and takes the other box the other half.
